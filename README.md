# ISTLandingNew

// In this updated landing page. We tried to futher consolidate IST(Interantional Sound Board of Turism) identity. 
// It's an attempt to further articulate our visual vision toward IST in a form of web experience. 
// We enjoy the result we acheived so far in the world of web development for the first time as a group who support each other during the process.

// This visual of morphing color circle was first developed by IST visual group and later found ways to relize. 
// Combined the learning and inspired by: Interactive Developer Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6EiRSRhsbQ
// the color gradient morphing was first developed by Jongmin Kim https://www.instagram.com/cmiscm
